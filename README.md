# udemy-ts-drag-drop
This is the code for the Udemy TypeScript project (Section 9)

At the bottom of most commits you will find notes about the code changes made during that commit. I only did this for commits with code changes that progress from the provious commit, so README.md updates don't have notes or navigation.
I manually added page-navigation to the commits that show progress in the form of code-changes as applied by following the course.

Some commits deal with key learning points, these I will try to list below in the "Key Commits" section.
