# udemy-ts-drag-drop
Course by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) | [Understanding typeScript - 2022 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/share/101sTi3@txHQIZUbxFrEWZRvwzklQTDchIc2f_t0A4JBHVRlwzCrfVl9zudwrfkDhRllkFZ-/)

At the bottom of most commits you will find notes about the code changes made during that commit. I only did this for commits with code changes that progress from the previous commit, so any commits to the README.md don't have notes or navigation.
I manually added page-navigation to the commits that show progress in the form of code-changes as applied by following the course.

Some commits deal with key learning points, these I will try to list below in the "Key Commits" section.

# Set-up
1. Clone the repo
2. Install Node.js if you haven't got it installed on your system yet.
3. In the Terminal run `npm install` in the root dir
4. Run `npm install -g typescript`
5. Run `tsc init`
6. Run `npm start` (leave it running)
7. Open a new Terminal and run `tsc -w` (leave it running)
8. In a 3rd teminal run `npx cypress open`

Splitting Files using ES Modules | A much better way to split TS (and JS) files. It has better type support and is the recommende route. This does not use WebPack yet. This will be added later | [:octocat:](https://github.com/monello/udemy-ts-drag-drop/commit/b555754339a3eba7f337a8de15ccea0880c4a6c4)

Arrow function and `this` keyword context | Here I removed all the code from the previous commit and converted the `submitHanlder()` function to an arrow function to prove how arrow-functions already handle the `this`-keyword context correctly | [:octocat:](https://github.com/monello/udemy-ts-drag-drop/commit/4a2dc12c2efd776e254fdbc48e03564fda044b11)

Singleton classes, Custom Event Listeners and Subscription pattern | This was the most difficult lecture to understand and get through. It deals with managing application state through the help of a Singleton class, Custom Event handlers and triggering the events through a **Subscription** pattern (I still don't have my mind completely wrapped around this concept yet) | [:octocat:](https://github.com/monello/udemy-ts-drag-drop/commit/97d72aa99c4e8c5e6398f93e7c2cf82f3d39b6f3)
