# udemy-ts-drag-drop
Course by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) | [Understanding typeScript - 2022 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/share/101sTi3@txHQIZUbxFrEWZRvwzklQTDchIc2f_t0A4JBHVRlwzCrfVl9zudwrfkDhRllkFZ-/)

At the bottom of most commits you will find notes about the code changes made during that commit. I only did this for commits with code changes that progress from the previous commit, so any commits to the README.md don't have notes or navigation.
I manually added page-navigation to the commits that show progress in the form of code-changes as applied by following the course.

Some commits deal with key learning points, these I will try to list below in the "Key Commits" section.

# Set-up
1. Clone the repo
2. Install Node.js if you haven't got it installed on your system yet.
3. In the Terminal run `npm install` in the root dir
4. Run `npm install -g typescript`
5. Run `tsc init`
6. Run `npm start` (leave it running)
7. Open a new Terminal and run `tsc -w` (leave it running)
8. In a 3rd teminal run `npx cypress open`

TODO | TODO |TODO
Example use of the enum type | Check out lines 4, 12 and 57 in this commit as a easy to follow exampleof how enums can be useful | [:octocat:](https://github.com/monello/udemy-ts-drag-drop/commit/917b8684347b356dd6592ed722d080e7ba6858f4)

Arrow function and `this` keyword context | Here I removed all the code from the previous commit and converted the `submitHanlder()` function to an arrow function to prove how arrow-functions already handle the `this`-keyword context correctly | [:octocat:](https://github.com/monello/udemy-ts-drag-drop/commit/4a2dc12c2efd776e254fdbc48e03564fda044b11)
Gathering User Input | Extracting user input from form input elements and outputting it in a Tuple | [:octocat:](https://github.com/monello/udemy-ts-drag-drop/commit/85ee37147637589ca01fabfe945adde9b8690046)
Data Validation | A basic example of doing data validation. Example usage of an interface to set up a custom Type. Examples of setting up optional properties in an interface (or class) | [:octocat:](https://github.com/monello/udemy-ts-drag-drop/commit/85ee37147637589ca01fabfe945adde9b8690046)
Testing Validation rules with Cypress | Some tests specs to test the validation rules on the form. Some interresting examples of how to asert the content in an alert box and also how to move repeating steps into `Cypress.Commands` | [:octocat:](https://github.com/monello/udemy-ts-drag-drop/commit/50768dfb60e26f85011adced62cf0d9dd9f093ea)

Singleton classes, Custom Event Listeners and Subscription pattern | This was the most difficult lecture to understand and get through. It deals with managing application state through the help of a Singleton class, Custom Event handlers and triggering the events through a **Subscription** pattern (I still don't have my mind completely wrapped around this concept yet) | [:octocat:](https://github.com/monello/udemy-ts-drag-drop/commit/97d72aa99c4e8c5e6398f93e7c2cf82f3d39b6f3)
Enum, Custom Types | Did some code refactoring to replace the temporary usage of the `any`-types with proper types. This commit shows examples of using an enum and a Custom Type that is a Function with a very specific structure | [:octocat:](https://github.com/monello/udemy-ts-drag-drop/commit/917b8684347b356dd6592ed722d080e7ba6858f4)
