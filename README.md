# udemy-ts-drag-drop
Course by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) | [Understanding typeScript - 2022 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/share/101sTi3@txHQIZUbxFrEWZRvwzklQTDchIc2f_t0A4JBHVRlwzCrfVl9zudwrfkDhRllkFZ-/)

At the bottom of most commits you will find notes about the code changes made during that commit. I only did this for commits with code changes that progress from the previous commit, so any commits to the README.md don't have notes or navigation.
I manually added page-navigation to the commits that show progress in the form of code-changes as applied by following the course.

Some commits deal with key learning points, these I will try to list below in the "Key Commits" section.

# Set-up

2. Install Node.js if you haven't got it installed on your system yet.
3. In the Terminal run `npm install` in the root dir
4. Run `npm install -g typescript`
5. Run `tsc init`

7. Open a new Terminal and run `tsc -w` (leave it running)
8. In a 3rd teminal run `npx cypress open`
